# UniteMe Productions

### 🚨 Issues and documentation
- All issues are tracked in GitHub, in the repos related to the issue.
- All documentation lives in GitHub, in README files and Wikis.

### 🌱 Git
- Our repos follow the _trunk-based branching model_ meaning `main` is the only long-lived branch and is expected to be in a releasable state at all times. [Learn more](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development).
- PRs must pass all checks and be up to date with `main` before being merged.

### 🧑🏽‍💻 Technology stack:
- Web-based front ends are written in TypeScipt using React, Chakra UI & Zustand. [Example boilerplate](https://github.com/tobyscott25/react-chakra-zustand-boiletplate)
- Backend services are written in Rust using Actix & PostgreSQL.

### 🌈 Contribution guidelines
Unfortunately we don't have the resources to support as much open access as we'd like, but contributions to any code we do have open source are more than welcome!
Please open issues and submit pull requests to your heart's content! Keep in mind the Git dot points above!

### 🍿 Fun fact
UniteMe was born thanks to a mutual friend, who introduced us after hearing our similar ideas.
